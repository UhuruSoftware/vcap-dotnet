Installation Notes
------------------

To run .Net on Cloud Foundry, the first thing you need is a Cloud Foundry installation. Refer to [http://www.github.com/CloudFoundry/vcap](http://www.github.com/CloudFoundry/vcap) for details on how to setup that up.

Once you have a Cloud Foundry setup running, you can either:

* get the code and compile it to get the installers (use the vcap-dotnet-installers solution)
* grab the latest release from here [http://www.uhurusoftware.com/vcap-dotnet/latest](http://www.uhurusoftware.com/vcap-dotnet/latest)

Install "Windows DEA.msi" and "MS Sql Node.msi" on a box that meets the following prerequisites:

* Windows 7 or Windows 2008 Server R2
* IIS 7
* MS SQL Server 2008 R2
